JSketch:
  I develop this game in OS X with the JDK version 1.8. The main development tool I use is Intellij IDEA.

The application is a Java simple drawing tool, I design by using MVC pattern. I create a Jmodel.java file to store the data of the application.  And I create two view to handle the UI. One is handle for the drawing tool and another one is for the canvas for drawing.

The application also supports the save and load option. When user click the “save”, the application will auto create a fill call “save”. If the file already exit then the new save will overwrite the file saved before. And when the user click “load” then the application will auto load the file saved most recently.

The Image I used for the tool icon is from the class example “PaintDemo” and the rest is Screen shoot by myself

I have finish the Customizable color palette Enhancement. Right chick for the color plane can display the color choser and change the color.`
